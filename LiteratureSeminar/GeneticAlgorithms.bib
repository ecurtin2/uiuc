@article{Kanters2014,
abstract = {A new flexible implementation of a genetic algorithm for locating unique low energy minima of isomers of clusters is described and tested. The strategy employed can be applied to molecular or atomic clusters and has a flexible input structure so that a system with several different elements can be built up from a set of individual atoms or from fragments made up of groups of atoms. This cluster program is tested on several systems, and the results are compared to computational and experimental data from previous studies. The quality of the algorithm for locating reliably the most competitive low energy structures of an assembly of atoms is examined for strongly bound Si–Li clusters, and ZnF2 clusters, and the more weakly interacting water trimers. The use of the nuclear repulsion energy as a duplication criterion, an increasing population size, and avoiding mutation steps without loss of efficacy are distinguishing features of the program. For the Si–Li clusters, a few new low energy minima are identified...},

@article{Mitchell2014,
abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are generally developed in computer science or adjacent disciplines and find their way into chemical modeling by a process of diffusion. Though particular machine learning methods are popular in chemoinformatics and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), many others exist in the technical literature. This discussion is methods-based and focused on some algorithms that chemoinformatics researchers frequently use. It makes no claim to be exhaustive. We concentrate on methods for supervised learning, predicting the unknown property values of a test set of instances, usually molecules, based on the known values for a training set. Particularly relevant approaches include Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors and na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers.Conflict of interest: The author has declared no conflicts of interest for this article.},

@article{Supady2015,
abstract = {The identification of low-energy conformers for a given molecule is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry and cheminformatics. We assess here a conformer search that employs a genetic algorithm for sampling the low-energy segment of the conformation space of molecules. The algorithm is designed to work with first-principles methods, facilitated by the incorporation of local optimization and blacklisting conformers to prevent repeated evaluations of very similar solutions. The aim of the search is not only to find the global minimum but to predict all conformers within an energy window above the global minimum. The performance of the search strategy is (i) evaluated for a reference data set extracted from a database with amino acid dipeptide conformers obtained by an extensive combined force field and first-principles search and (ii) compared to the performance of a systematic search and a random conformer generator for the example of a drug-like ligand with 43 atoms, 8 rotatable bonds, and 1 ci...},

@article{Weigend2014,
abstract = {Energy surfaces of metal clusters usually show a large variety of local minima. For homo-metallic species the energetically lowest can be found reliably with genetic algorithms, in combination with density functional theory without system-specific parameters. For mixed-metallic clusters this is much more difficult, as for a given arrangement of nuclei one has to find additionally the best of many possibilities of assigning different metal types to the individual positions. In the framework of electronic structure methods this second issue is treatable at comparably low cost at least for elements with similar atomic number by means of first-order perturbation theory, as shown previously [F. Weigend, C. Schrodt, and R. Ahlrichs, J. Chem. Phys. 121, 10380 (2004)]. In the present contribution the extension of a genetic algorithm with the re-assignment of atom types to atom sites is proposed and tested for the search of the global minima of PtHf12 and [LaPb7Bi7](4-). For both cases the (putative) global minimum is reliably found with the extended technique, which is not the case for the "pure" genetic algorithm.},
