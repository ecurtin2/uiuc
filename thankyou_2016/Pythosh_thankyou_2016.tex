%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\opening{Dear Mr. Mark and Mrs. Hilda Pytosh,}
%[Paragraph 1]
%Start by thanking the donor for your fellowship (include the name the fellowship). Let
%your donor know how grateful you are to receive their support and how the fellowship
%is helping you.

I just learned that I'll be receiving the Mark Pytosh Fellowship for the 2016-2017 academic year, and I wanted to thank you for your generosity in making this possible! In order to pursue my degree at Illinois, I've moved away from home and this will allow me to visit my friends and family for the first time in over a year. I likely won't be able to convey my gratitude in a single letter, but I'll try my best. 

%[Paragraph 2]
%In this paragraph, you should tell the donor about yourself. For example, where you are
%from, a little about your educational background before entering Illinois, and some
%activities you are currently involved in.
 I grew up in Lansdale, Pennsylvania which is a suburb about 45 minutes outside of Philadelphia by train or car. My grandpa got a degree in Chemical Engineering at Drexel University in Philly and was my main inspiration for going to Drexel for my B.S. in Chemistry. During my time there, I discovered that I really enjoyed the fundamental physics and math that underpins chemistry. This caused me to switch into the dual BS/MS program with a heavy focus on physics and computational method development in chemistry. During this time I worked on developing a few new methods, and I realized I loved the method development field of computational chemistry. This was the major reason I decided to pursue my PhD. 

%[Paragraph 3]
%Next, you should tell the donor why you chose Illinois, why you selected your major,
%what your plans are for the future, both long and short term. For example: employment
%goals & plans, transfer intentions, special opportunities youâ€™ve discovered at Illinois
%and long-range career goals.
I chose to go to UIUC for my PhD because of the outstanding reputation it has, not only in chemistry, but also in computer science and physics, which are all intimately intertwined in my current research with Dr. So Hirata. I think I have a fantastic opportunity here to learn methods that are desirable in today's workforce as well as in fundamental chemistry method development. After I finish my program at Illinois, I plan on utilizing my experience in computational science to transition towards data science. Since I've always been generally curious about pretty much everything, I really think I'll enjoy being able to generalize my experiences in order to apply my knowledge in various fields. I've been thinking about transitioning towards finance or industrial research in the long-term, but for now my plan is to stay flexible.  

%[Closing paragraph]
%Then thank the donor again, letting them know how much the fellowship is valued.
Again I want to express my gratitude for receiving this fellowship, which is only possible because of you. It will go a long way in helping me both with my student loans and travel to see my family, which will do a great deal to help me get through the rigors of the PhD program here at UIUC. So thank you, and I won't forget this generosity!

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
