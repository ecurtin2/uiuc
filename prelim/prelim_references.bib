abstract = {We present a structural data set of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids and their amino-methylated and acetylated (capped) dipeptides. Different protonation states of the backbone (uncharged and zwitterionic) were considered for the amino acids as well as varied side chain protonation states. Furthermore, we studied amino acids and dipeptides in complex with divalent cations (Ca(2+), Ba(2+), Sr(2+), Cd(2+), Pb(2+), and Hg(2+)). The database covers the conformational hierarchies of 280 systems in a wide relative energy range of up to 4 eV (390 kJ/mol), summing up to a total of 45,892 stationary points on the respective potential-energy surfaces. All systems were calculated on equal first-principles footing, applying density-functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation corrected for long-range van der Waals interactions. We show good agreement to available experimental data for gas-phase ion affinities. Our curated data can be utilized, for example, for a wide comparison across chemical space of the building blocks of life, for the parametrization of protein force fields, and for the calculation of reference spectra for biophysical applications.},

abstract = {The genetic algorithm (GA) is an intelligent approach for finding minima in a highly dimensional parametric space. However, the success of GA searches for low energy conformations of biomolecules is rather limited so far. Herein an improved GA scheme is proposed for the conformational search of oligopeptides. A systematic analysis of the backbone dihedral angles of conformations of amino acids (AAs) and dipeptides is performed. The structural information is used to design a new encoding scheme to improve the efficiency of GA search. Local geometry optimizations based on the energy calculations by the density functional theory are employed to safeguard the quality and reliability of the GA structures. The GA scheme is applied to the conformational searches of Lys, Arg, Met-Gly, Lys-Gly, and Phe-Gly-Gly representative of AAs, dipeptides, and tripeptides with complicated side chains. Comparison with the best literature results shows that the new GA method is both highly efficient and reliable by providing the most complete set of the low energy conformations. Moreover, the computational cost of the GA method increases only moderately with the complexity of the molecule. The GA scheme is valuable for the study of the conformations and properties of oligopeptides. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {For molecules with complex and competing magnetic interactions, it is often the case that the lowest energy Hartree-Fock solution may only be obtained by removing the spin and time-reversal symmetry constraints of the exact non-relativistic Hamiltonian. To do so results in the complex generalized Hartree-Fock (GHF) method. However, with the loss of variational constraints comes the greater possibility of converging to higher energy minima. Here, we report the implementation of stability test of the complex GHF equations, along with an orbital update scheme should an instability be found. We apply the methodology to finding the local minima of several spin-frustrated hydrogen rings, as well as the non-collinear molecular magnet Cr3, illustrating the utility of the broken symmetry GHF method and some of its lesser-known nuances.},

We assess here a conformer search that employs a genetic algorithm for sampling the low-energy segment of the conformation space of molecules. The algorithm is designed to work with first-principles methods, facilitated by the incorporation of local optimization and blacklisting conformers to prevent repeated evaluations of very similar solutions. The aim of the search is not only to find the global minimum but to predict all conformers within an energy window above the global minimum. The performance of the search strategy is (i) evaluated for a reference data set extracted from a database with amino acid dipeptide conformers obtained by an extensive combined force field and first-principles search and (ii) compared to the performance of a systematic search and a random conformer generator for the example of a drug-like ligand with 43 atoms, 8 rotatable bonds, and 1 ci...},

abstract = {We discuss diagrammatic modifications to the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) equations, wherein different groups of terms out of rings, ladders, crossed-rings, and mosaics can be removed to form approximations to the coupled cluster method, of interest due to their similarity with various types of random phase approximations. The finite uniform electron gas (UEG) is benchmarked for 14- and 54-electron systems at the complete basis set limit over a wide density range and performance of different flavours of CCD is determined. These results confirm that rings generally overcorrelate and ladders generally undercorrelate; mosaics-only CCD yields a result surprisingly close to CCD. We use a recently developed numerical analysis [J. J. Shepherd and A. Gr{\"{u}}neis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 226401 (2013)] to study the behaviours of these methods in the thermodynamic limit. We determine that the mosaics, on forming the Brueckner one-body Hamiltonian, open a gap in the effective one-particle eigenvalues at the Fermi energy. Numerical evidence is presented which shows that methods based on this renormalisation have convergent energies in the thermodynamic limit including mosaic-only CCD, which is just a renormalised MP2. All other methods including only a single channel, namely, ladder-only CCD, ring-only CCD, and crossed-ring-only CCD, appear to yield divergent energies; incorporation of mosaic terms prevents this from happening.},

This cluster program is tested on several systems, and the results are compared to computational and experimental data from previous studies. The quality of the algorithm for locating reliably the most competitive low energy structures of an assembly of atoms is examined for strongly bound Si–Li clusters, and ZnF2 clusters, and the more weakly interacting water trimers. The use of the nuclear repulsion energy as a duplication criterion, an increasing population size, and avoiding mutation steps without loss of efficacy are distinguishing features of the program.

abstract = {The Lanczos method is often used to solve a large and sparse symmetric matrix eigenvalue problem. It is well-known that the single-vector Lanczos method can only find one copy of any multiple eigenvalue. To compute all or some of the copies of a multiple eigenvalue, one has to use the block Lanczos method which is also known to compute clustered eigenvalues much faster than the single-vector Lanczos method. Existing convergence theory due to Saad for the block Lanczos method, however, does not fully reflect this phenomenon due to that the theory was established to bound approximation errors in each individual approximate eigenpairs. It is argued that in the presence of an eigenvalue cluster, the entire approximate eigenspace associated with the cluster should be considered as a whole, instead of each individual approximate eigenvectors, and likewise for approximating the cluster of eigenvalues. In this paper, we obtain error bounds on approximating eigenspaces and eigenvalue clusters. Our bounds are much sharper than the existing ones and expose more realistic rates of convergence of the block Lanczos method towards eigenvalue clusters. Numerical examples are presented to support our claims. Also a possible extension to the generalized eigenvalue problem is outlined.},

Using the Hartree-Fock wave function as a reference, perturbative (M{\{}{\o}{\}}ller-Plesset) and coupled cluster theories are used to study the uniform electron gas model. Our findings suggest that nonperturbative coupled cluster theories are acceptable for modeling electronic interactions in metals while perturbative coupled cluster theories are not. Using screened interactions, we propose a simple modification to the widely used coupled cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples method that lifts the divergent behavior and is shown to give very accurate correlation energies for the homogeneous electron gas.},

abstract = {Highly accurate results for the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) have only been achieved to date within a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) framework. Here, we introduce a newly developed stochastic technique, Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which samples the exact wavefunction expanded in plane wave Slater determinants. Despite the introduction of a basis set incompleteness error, we obtain a finite-basis energy which is significantly, and variationally lower than any previously published work for the 54-electron HEG at {\$}r{\_}s{\$} = 0.5 a.u., in a Hilbert space of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}108{\}}{\$} Slater determinants. At this value of {\$}r{\_}s{\$}, as well as of 1.0 a.u., we remove the remaining basis set incompleteness error by extrapolation, yielding results comparable or better than state-of-the-art DMC backflow energies. In doing so, we demonstrate that it is possible to yield highly accurate results with the FCIQMC method in sizable periodic systems.},

abstract = {We use molecular simulations using a coarse-grained model to map the folding landscape of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is extensively used as a marker in cell biology and biotechnology. Thermal and Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) induced unfolding of a variant of GFP, without the chromophore, occurs in an apparent two-state manner. The calculated midpoint of the equilibrium folding in GdmCl, taken into account using the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM), is in excellent agreement with the experiments. The melting temperatures decrease linearly as the concentrations of GdmCl and urea are increased. The structural features of rarely populated equilibrium intermediates, visible only in free energy profiles projected along a few order parameters, are remarkably similar to those identified in a number of ensemble experiments in GFP with the chromophore. The excellent agreement between simulations and experiments show that the equilibrium intermediates are stabilized by the chromophore. Folding kinetics, upon temperature quench, show that GFP first collapses and populates an ensemble of compact structures. Despite the seeming simplicity of the equilibrium folding, flux to the native state flows through multiple channels and can be described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism. Detailed analysis of the folding trajectories show that both equilibrium and several kinetic intermediates, including misfolded structures, are sampled during folding. Interestingly, the intermediates characterized in the simulations coincide with those identified in single molecule pulling experiments. Our predictions, amenable to experimental tests, show that MTM is a practical way to simulate the effect of denaturants on the folding of large proteins.},

abstract = {An electronic structure method is said to be size-consistent if the energy of noninteracting fragments is the same when the fragments are treated in a supermolecule approach or are treated in isolation. Size consistency is often violated by Hartree-Fock when symmetries of the exact wave function are imposed on the Hartree-Fock determinant. Relaxing the requirement that the Hartree-Fock wave function be a spin eigenfunction leads to unrestricted Hartree-Fock, which is often (but not always) size-consistent. In this Perspective, we discuss the usually forgotten fact that imposing none of the exact symmetries in what is known as generalized Hartree-Fock allows Hartree-Fock to always be size-consistent and allows size extensive correlated methods such as coupled cluster theory to also be size-consistent. Furthermore, with all symmetries broken, dissociation curves connect the molecule to the fragments better than with symmetries imposed, although the curves are not smooth and show derivative discontinuities akin to unphysical phase transitions. In many cases, correlated dissociation curves based on this generalized Hartree-Fock reference are discontinuous.},

abstract = {Matrix eigenvalue problems arise in a large number of disciplines$\backslash$nof sciences and engineering. They constitute the basic tool used$\backslash$nin designing buildings, bridges, and turbines, that are resistent$\backslash$nto vibrations. They allow to model queueing networks, and to analyze$\backslash$nstability of electrical networks or fluid flow. They also allow the$\backslash$nscientist to understand local physical phenonema or to study bifurcation$\backslash$npatterns in dynamical systems. In fact the writing of this book was$\backslash$nmotivated mostly by the second class of problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSeveral books dealing with numerical methods for solving eigenvalue$\backslash$nproblems involving symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices have been written$\backslash$nand there are a few software packages both public and commercial$\backslash$navailable. The book by Parlett [148] is an excellent treatise of$\backslash$nthe problem. Despite a rather strong demand by engineers and scientists$\backslash$nthere is little written on nonsymmetric problems and even less is$\backslash$navailable in terms of software. The 1965 book by Wilkinson [222]$\backslash$nstill constitutes an important reference. Certainly, science has$\backslash$nevolved since the writing of Wilkinson�s book and so has the computational$\backslash$nenvironment and the demand for solving large matrix problems. Problems$\backslash$nare becoming larger and more complicated while at the same time computers$\backslash$nare able to deliver ever higher performances. This means in particular$\backslash$nthat methods that were deemed too demanding yesterday are now in$\backslash$nthe realm of the achievable. I hope that this book will be a small$\backslash$nstep in bridging the gap between the literature on what is available$\backslash$nin the symmetric case and the nonsymmetric case. Both the Hermitian$\backslash$nand the non-Hermitian case are covered, although non-Hermitian problems$\backslash$nare given more emphasis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis book attempts to achieve a good balance between theory and practice.$\backslash$nI should comment that the theory is especially important in the nonsymmetric$\backslash$ncase. In essence what differentiates the Hermitian from the non-Hermitian$\backslash$neigenvalue problem is that in the first case we can always manage$\backslash$nto compute an approximation whereas there are nonsymmetric problems$\backslash$nthat can be arbitrarily difficult to solve and can essentially make$\backslash$nany algorithm fail. Stated more rigorously, the eigenvalue of a Hermitian$\backslash$nmatrix is always well-conditioned whereas this is not true for nonsymmetric$\backslash$nmatrices. On the practical side, I tried to give a general view of$\backslash$nalgorithms and tools that have proved efficient. Many of the algorithms$\backslash$ndescribed correspond to actual implementations of research software$\backslash$nand have been tested on realistic problems. I have tried to convey$\backslash$nour experience from the practice in using these techniques.},

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute "ab initio molecular simulations" (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Determining the true HF ground state has remained a challenge. Using numerical calculations for finite systems and analytic techniques, we study the HF ground state of the 3D electron gas. At high density, we find broken spin symmetry states with a nearly constant charge density. Unlike previously discussed spin wave states, the observed wave vector of the SDW is smaller than {\$}2 kF. The broken-symmetry state originates from pairing instabilities at the Fermi surface, a model for which is proposed.},

A one-after-another technique based on the scaled hypersphere search method has been successfully applied to exploring unknown chemical structures, transition structures, and reaction pathways for organometallic systems. Upon metal substitution, considerable changes of stable structures, reaction pathways, and relative heights of transition structures have been discovered, though some features are similar among the analogues. Al and Cu atoms were found to behave as very strong scissors to cut the CO double bond in MCHO. Energy profiles of the CO insertion into Li-H and Li-CH3 bonds were found to be very similar, especially around the structures where the Li atom is not directly connected with the methyl group, which indicates little effects of alkyl substitution on the reaction route topology.},

This book provides an in-depth introduction to the physics of the interacting electron liquid in a broad variety of systems, including metals, semiconductors, artificial nano-structures, atoms and molecules. One, two and three dimensional systems are treated separately and in parallel. Different phases of the electron liquid, from the Landau Fermi liquid to the Wigner crystal, from the Luttinger liquid to the quantum Hall liquid are extensively discussed. Both static and time-dependent density functional theory are presented in detail. Although the emphasis is on the development of the basic physical ideas and on a critical discussion of the most useful approximations, the formal derivation of the results is highly detailed and based on the simplest, most direct methods.},

Such systems provide a natural testing ground for questions of principle, as the local-density approximation should be highly accurate since for this interaction type the exchange contribution to the local-density approximation is intrinsically self-interaction-free. The exact-exchange contribution to the total energy is a local functional of the density. A local-density approximation for correlation is obtained using perturbation theory and Bethe ansatz results for the one-dimensional contact-interacting uniform Fermi gas. The ground-state energies are calculated for two finite systems, the analogs of helium and of Hooke's atom. The local-density approximation is shown to be excellent as expected.},

abstract = {Coupled-cluster theory with connected single and double excitation operators (CCSD) and related approximations, such as linearized CCSD, quadratic configuration interaction with single and double excitation operators, coupled-cluster with connected double excitation operator (CCD), linearized CCD, approximate CCD, and second- and third-order many-body perturbation theories, are formulated and implemented for infinitely extended one-dimensional systems (polymers), on the basis of the periodic boundary conditions and distance-based screening of integrals, density matrix elements, and excitation amplitudes. The variation of correlation energies with the truncation radii of short- and long-range lattice sums and with the number of wave vector sampling points in the first Brillouin zone is examined for polyethylene, polyacetylene, and polyyne, and is shown to be a function of the degree of pi-electron conjugation or the fundamental band gaps. The t2 and t1 amplitudes in the atomic orbital (AO) basis are obtained by first computing the t amplitudes in the Bloch-orbital basis and subsequently back-transforming them into the AO basis. The plot of these AO-based t amplitudes as a function of unit cells also indicates that the t2 amplitudes of polyacetylene and polyyne exhibit appreciably slower decay than those of polyethylene, although the asymptotic decay behavior is invariably 1/r3. The AO-based t1 amplitudes appear to correlate strongly with the electronic structure, and they decay seemingly exponentially for polyethylene whereas they stay at a constant magnitude across the seventh nearest neighbors of polyacetylene and polyyne, which attests to far reaching effects of nondynamical electron correlation mediated by orbital rotation. Nonetheless, the unit cell contributions to the correlation energies taper below 10(-6) hartree after 15 A for all three polymers. The basis set dependence of the decay behavior of t2 amplitudes is also examined for linear hydrogen fluoride polymer (HF)infinity and linear beryllium polymer (Be)infinity employing the STO-3G, 6-31G, and 6-31G* basis sets, and proves to be rather small.},

abstract = {We present self-consistent calculations of the spin-averaged pair distribution function g(r) for a homogeneous electron gas in the paramagnetic state in both three and two dimensions, based on an extension of a model that was originally proposed by Overhauser [Can. J. Phys. 73, 683 (1995)] and further evaluated by Gori-Giorgi and Perdew [Phys. Rev. B 64, 155102 (2001)]. The model involves the solution of a two-electron scattering problem via an effective Coulombic potential, which we determine within a self-consistent Hartree approximation. We find numerical results for g(r) that are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo data at low and intermediate coupling strength rs, extending up to rs≈10 in dimensionality D=3. However, the Hartree approximation does not properly account for the emergence of a first-neighbor peak at stronger coupling, such as at rs=5 in D=2, and has limited accuracy in regard to the spin-resolved components g↑↑(r) and g↑↓(r). We also report calculations of the electron-electron s-wave scattering length, to test an analytical expression proposed by Overhauser in D=3 and to present new results in D=2 at moderate coupling strength. Finally, we indicate how this approach can be extended to evaluate the pair distribution functions in inhomogeneous electron systems and hence to obtain improved exchange-correlation energy functionals.},

abstract = {In solution most of the peptides assume multiple flexible conformations. Determination of the dominant conformers and evaluation of their populations is the aim of peptide conformation studies, in which theoretical and experimental methods play complementary roles. Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods are quite effective in searching the conformational space accessible to a peptide but they are not able to estimate, precisely enough, the populations of various conformations. Therefore, they must be supplemented by experimental data. In this paper, a short review of the experimental methods, most widely used in peptide conformational studies, is presented. Among them NMR plays the leading role. Valuable information is also obtained from hydrogen exchange, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and circular dichroism measurements. The advantages and shortcomings of these methods are discussed.},

abstract = {An extension of density-functional theory, designed to treat spin-density waves and antiferromagnetic systems, is presented. The nonlocal nature of the antiferromagnetic correlations and possible noncollinearity in spin space are incorporated via an additional fundamental variable, the staggered density, which supplements the spin densities of conventional density-functional theory. Inclusion of this variable is justified by both physical and methodological considerations. We prove the corresponding Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, derive the pertinent Kohn-Sham equations, and present several approximate functionals depending explicitly on the staggered density. As a first test the formalism is applied to two simple model systems, a one-dimensional electron gas with a short-range interaction, and the three-dimensional electron gas with Coulomb interactions. These calculations serve to test the developed formalism, bur also already allow us to draw a number of conclusions regarding the stability and nature of possible spin-density wave states in homogeneous electron systems.},

abstract = {A novel and robust automated docking method that predicts the bound conformations of flexible ligands to macromolecular targets has been developed and tested, in combination with a new scoring function that estimates the free energy change upon binding. Interestingly, this method applies a Lamarckian model of genetics, in which environmental adaptations of an individual's phenotype are reverse transcribed into its genotype and become {\v{Z}} . heritable traits sic . We consider three search methods, Monte Carlo simulated annealing, a traditional genetic algorithm, and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, and compare their performance in dockings of seven protein᎐ligand test systems having known three-dimensional structure. We show that both the traditional and Lamarckian genetic algorithms can handle ligands with more degrees of freedom than the simulated annealing method used in earlier versions of AUTODOCK, and that the Lamarckian genetic algorithm is the most efficient, reliable, and successful of the three. The empirical free energy function was calibrated using a set of 30 structurally known protein᎐ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding constants. Linear regression analysis of the observed binding constants in terms of a wide variety of structure-derived molecular properties was performed. The final model had a residual standard y1 {\v{Z}} y1 . error of 9.11 kJ mol 2.177 kcal mol and was chosen as the new energy},

abstract = {We demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) search procedure for finding low-energy conformations of small to medium organic molecules (1-12 rotatable bonds). GAs are in a class of biologically motivated optimization methods that evolve a population of individuals where individuals who are more ''fit'' have a higher probability of surviving into subsequent generations. Here, an individual is a conformation of a given molecule and the fitness is the molecule's conformational energy. In the course of a simulated evolution, the population produces conformations having increasingly lower energy. We test the GA method on a suite of 72 molecules and compare the performance against the CSEARCH algorithm in Sybyl. For molecules with more than eight rotatable bonds, the GA method is more efficient computationally and as the number of rotatable bonds increases the relative efficiency of the GA method grows. The GA method also found energies equal to or lower than the energy of the relaxed crystal structure in the large majority of cases. (C) 1993 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {For original paper see B.K. Rao et al., ibid., vol.9, p.L51 (1979). Dynamical exchange effects in the dielectric function of jellium are described by a frequency-dependent local field function G(q, omega ), which the authors earlier derived by the dynamical exchange decoupling method. In the present note, it is analytically deduced that this expression for G(q, omega ) is logarithmically divergent at omega =h(cross) mod q2/2+or-qk m mod m. This logarithmic singularity is due to the discontinuity of the equilibrium distribution function at the Fermi level. In a recent comment, Rao et al. argued that G(q, omega ) does not exhibit a singular behaviour. This statement is shown to be incorrect.},

abstract = {The dielectric response of a quasi-one-dimensional system of interacting electrons has been investigated. In the authors' model the particles move freely in one direction and are tightly bound in the transverse direction. Calculation of the Coulomb matrix elements leads to an effective one-dimensional electron-electron interaction nu (q) which is less singular for small q than the 1/q2 potential assumed by previous authors. As a result, the excitonic instability which they find even for a rigid positive background does not arise in their calculation. The calculations are based on the approximation of Singwi, Tosi, Land and Sjolander (1968). As expected in this approach, the pair correlation function at small distances remains positive over a much larger range of densities than that for which the compressibility sum rule is satisfied. The static dielectric function is negative around q=2kF, which suggests the possibility of charge ordering when the background is allowed to be polarisable. If nu (q) is replaced by a delta -function potential, a numerical calculation of the energy for the exact solution of Yang may be made. On comparison with the result obtained with the method of Singwi et al. it is found that the approximate scheme gives good correlation energies for high densities.},

abstract = {An exact stochastic simulation of the Schroedinger equation for charged bosons and fermions has been used to calculate the correlation energies, to locate the transitions to their respective crystal phases at zero temperature within 10{\%}, and to establish the stability at intermediate densities of a ferromagnetic fluid of electrons. PACS numbers: 67.90.+i, 71.45.6m The properties of the ground state of the elec-tron gas, also referred to as the fermion one-component plasma and jellium, have rigorously only been established in the limit of high densi-ties' where the system approaches a perfect gas and at low density' where the electrons crystal-lize. Further more, Hartr ee-Fock calculations' and variational calculations4 suggest that at inter-mediate densities, the spin-aligned state of the electrons will be more stable than the normal, unpolarized state. Precise calculations of this many-fermion system are required to establish the regions of stability of the various phases be-cause of the small energy differences among them. This note outlines a Monte Carlo method that, if run long enough on a computer, can give as precise a solution for the ground state of a given fermion system as desired. In practice, the precision of such a calculation is limited to about two orders of magnitude small-er than that of an approximate trial wave func-tion that is introduced as an importance function in the Monte Carlo process. That the introduc-tion of such an importance function is essential was previously demonstrated for the many-boson problem. ' The extension of this boson calcula-tion to fermions requires dealing with antisym-metric functions whose nodes are unknown. This leads to two related complications; namely, the probability density of a random walk cannot be chosen everywhere positive, and unless prevented the random walk will always converge to the all positive, boson ground state. It is demonstrated here that by representing the wave function by the difference between two probability densities, the effect of this inherent instability becomes serious, and it is possible to extract the proper-ties of the lowest antisymmetric state. A more general procedure which removes the effects of the instability has yet to be perfected. The solution of the fermion problem was car-ried out in two steps. In the first step the nodes, the places where the trial function vanishes, act as fixed absorbing barriers to the diffusion proc-ess. Inside a connected nodal region the wave function is everywhere positive and vanishes at the boundaries. With these boundary conditions, the fermion problem is equivalent to a boson problem. The energy calculated with this proce-dure, which we will refer to as the "fixed-node" energy, is an upper bound to the exact fermion ground-state energy and generally very close to it. In principle one could next vary the nodal loca-tions to obtain the best upper bound, for example, by varying the functions used as elements in the Slater determinant of the trial wave function. In practice, the highly dimensional nodal surfaces are difficult to parametrize in a systematic fash-ion. The second step, called "nodal relaxation, " begins with the population of walks from the "fixed-node" approximation. In this second proce-dure, if a random walk strays across the node of the trial function it is not terminated, but the sign of its contribution to any average is re-versed. At any stage of the random walk there is a population of positive walks (those that re-mained in the same nodal region or crossed an even number of nodes) and a population of nega-tive walks (those that crossed an odd number of nodes). The importance function used in this process is the absolute value of the trial function. It can be easily shown that the difference popula-tion converges to the antisymmetric eigenfunc-tion. However, both the positive and negative populations grow geometrically with a rate equal to the difference between the Fermi and Bose en-ergies. If the relaxation time from the fixed-node 566 1980 The American Physical Society VOLUME 45, NUMBER 7 PHYSICAL RKVIKW LETTERS 18 AUGvsr 1980 r E f T where B is the Hamiltonian 2 (2) It is easily verified that for large times, f(r, t) = 4ry, exp[-t(E " f — E,)j, where E, and p, are the exact eigenvalue and eigenfunction. The above equation for f(R, t) has a simple interpretation as a stochastic process. Each member of the en-semble of systems undergoes (i) random diffu-sion caused by the zero-point motion, (ii) bias-ing or drift by the trial quantum force, Vln1@r1', and (iii) branching with probability given by the time step times the difference between the local trial energy, Er=H+r/4r, and the arbitrarily chosen reference energy, E " f. By *'branching", it is meant that a particular system is either eliminated from the ensemble (if the local energy is greater than the reference energy) or dupli-cated in the ensemble (otherwise). A steady-state population of the ensemble requires that the reference energy equal the lowest eigenvalue. This is one way of determining the eigenvalue. The trial wave function employed in the present calculations is identical with those used in an earlier Monte Carlo variational calculation. This trial function is a product of two-body cor-relation factors times a Slater determinant of single-particle orbitals. The two-body correla-tion factors are chosen such that they remove distribution times this energy difference is less than unity, the fermion energy can be reliably extracted. We have found that for the electron gas this condition is satisfied if the nodes of the Hartree-Fock wave function are used. our simulation method is a simpler version of the Green's function Monte Carlo method of Kalos, Levesque, and Verlet. ' However, it requires numerical truncation. A trial wave function Cr(R) of the Bijl-Jastrow-Slater type4 and an ensemble of about 100 systems are selected from a varia-tional Monte Carlo calculation, where R repre-sents the 3N spatial coordinates of the system of N electrons.

@article{Mermin1963,
abstract = {The thermal Hartree-Fock approximation of Green's function theory is shown to be equivalent, in its thermodynamic consequences, to the use of that density matrix which makes the free energy stationary over a simply restricted class of trial density matrices. The variational formulation provides a stability condition requiring one to reject those solutions of the thermal Hartree-Fock equations which do not correspond to local minima of the free energy. If only stable Hartree-Fock propagators are used, then the spectrum of density oscillations as calculated in the thermal random phase approximation can be shown to have only real frequencies. Reasons for the thermal {\{}RPA{\}} becoming unstable may therefore be found from studying the significance of unstable Hartree-Fock solutions. It is shown that isothermals with positive slope can occur in the Hartree-Fock equation of state only if an unstable solution has been used. This suggests that one type of instability is associated with a first order phase transition. This is confirmed when the approximation is applied to a lattice gas with attractive interactions. The equation of state is of the van der Waals type if the stability condition is ignored. If only solutions which give global minima to the free energy are used, the corrected isothermals are those which result from applying the Maxwell equal area construction to the naive ones. Unstable solutions correspond to the parts of the van der Waals isothermals with positive slope. The physically metastable parts correspond to solutions which are local but not global minima. A lattice gas with repulsive interactions illustrates another type of instability, characterizing a second order phase transition. In this case the naive solution becomes unstable even though no pathological behaviour appears in its equation of state, and solutions corresponding to a spatially nonuniform density of particles are required to restore stability.},

@article{Thouless1961,
abstract = {The properties of those states which can be obtained by exciting a single particle from the ground state of a nucleus are studied by using a perturbation-theory expansion for the Green's function. The formula obtained differs from the one used in a straightforward shall model calculation in some important respects. By comparing this formula with the condition for a solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to give a minimum of the expectation value of the energy, derived in an earlier paper, it is shown that it is always possible to choose an independent particle wave function which makes all collective modes stable in the random phase approximation. A study of the formal properties of solutions of the equation shows that the wave functions should be normalized using an indefinite metric: different eigenfunctions are then orthogonal. The eigenfunctions form a complete set, if there is no degeneracy in the solution of the Hartree-Fock equations, but not if there is a degeneracy. An upper bound for the lowest energy level is established, and the rule for calculating matrix elements of one-particle operators between the ground state and an excited state is given. It is shown to follow from the self-consistent field condition that the energy-weighted sum rules are preserved in this approximation. A discussion of spurious states is given, and it is shown that they separate out and have zero energy. A vector introduced in our earlier discussion of the cranking model is shown to be independent of all eigenvectors in this case.},

abstract = {An expression for a general Slater determinant is written in the notation of second quantization. This expression has just the right number of arbitrary coefficients, so no subsidiary conditions are required, and the expression for a particular determinant is unique. This notation is used to study two problems. Firstly, a condition for a particular solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is derived. This condition is equivalent to the condition for stability of collective modes in the random phase approximation. Secondly, the determinant which minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian while giving a particular value to the expectation value of a component of angular momentum is found. In this way, an expression for the moment of inertia of an axially symmetric system is derived within the framework of the Hartree-Fock theory. The expression for a determinant is generalized to include the type of wave functions used in the theory of superconductivity.},
